            <p class="mb-5">I just got done removing the Firefox Snap off of my system again on Ubuntu,
                so now comes the time I really have to vent about some of these design choices. 
                I want to talk about Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish. But more specifically, Snap packages in Ubuntu and why they are a bad plan, back then and still.
                But first let me preface this to answer the question from Ubuntu distro-haters: “Why are you on Ubuntu to begin with, it's a noob distro?”</p>
                
                <p class="mb-5">Call me crazy, I actually genuinely enjoy Canonicals’ implementation of the GNOME Desktop Environment. I also like how the syntax of Ubuntu/Debain commands makes a lot of sense to me, and they’re easy to remember. I used Arch Linux and Manjaro for a while as well, but I was getting kind of tired of having the rolling releases. While I do feel like Ubuntu on average is way too far behind when it comes to versions of software, I do much prefer having the stability of fixed release over being on the bleeding edge at all times like on Arch Linux. 
                The fact that most stuff from the Arch Linux wiki works interchangeably between that and Ubuntu is nice too, since Arch has a much better documentation. </p>
                <p class="mb-5">A lot of the configuration files and commands for the lower level system components, such as the Linux service and sys manager (systemd), the X Window System (x11) and the Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB), all work the same as well. All in all, it's just less of a hassle than Arch, but with the bonus of some transferable knowledge.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Despite my apparently innate hatred for Ubuntu’s Snap packages, on average I think Ubuntu is an amazing template to build your own Linux workstation on. Especially for people that don’t feel the need to dive as deep into documentation as Arch requires you to do. Kali’s default toolset is great, but I don’t actually like to sit and spend a lot of time working inside a Kali box at all. I think for an actual distro to work in, it’s highly overrated. In any case, this rant was not about Linux distro’s or why I like using this one anyways, it’s about why snaps suck.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">So first, a small intro for the uninitiated. APT is the ‘Advanced Package Tool’ in Ubuntu/Debian.
                APT was always the 'main' way of installing packages to the system. Actually, apt is the front-end functionality that talks to the underlying functionality called dpkg. In practice, the 'apt install' command for example, creates a topological list of all the packages, and then calls the dpkg function in the most optimal order to install these. 
                Of course, nothing in this world works perfectly, and neither does dpkg.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Especially in a situation where you want to install 2 different versions of the exact same package you will run into issues. This is not really an issue with dpkg itself, but more with not-containerizing, I suppose. It could definitely improve at these types of resolving dependency-conflicts a lot better, as far as that is possible without introducing the type of sand-boxing that snaps do.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">So snap packages came by and kind fixed this issue of not being able to install 2 different version of that same package. They achieve this simply by being these self-contained apps running inside their own sandboxes with some mediated access to the underlying host system. As such, they don’t care about any duplicate packages on the system, and you can always install them without problems.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-5">The above solution that Snaps provide is unfortunately also the exact reason that they end up working so much worse than all of their deb counterparts in most situations.
                Snaps are, as we just discussed, small virtual boxes/containers, similar to flatpaks on other distro’s. Yes, it’s nice that you're not required to chase any additional required packages for the main
                application you were installing, or running into any duplicate packages issues with the version conflicts we talked about. The idea is that you just click on install from inside the store, and off you go.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">But, snaps actually just don't work as well as Canonical wants them to work, period. 
                Certainly not compared to any other app that has a regular .deb version to install from. There are some select Snaps that do work well, but it’s honestly the minority of them.
                Wanting to make it easier to install software in Ubuntu for end-users, containerize apps and be able to push directly into upstream branches, is all great on paper. But, when critical features of the software don’t work yet in Snaps, either because of the fact that you sand-boxed them so much that they lost core functionalities, or the way you install them from the software center is actually so incredibly buggy, we are clearly introducing more problems than we are fixing.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">The first major flaw is that Snaps often don't even install correctly, in many cases, and they are poorly/not maintained in a lot of other cases. In the past even malicious Snaps have appeared in the Snap store. So even quality control of software, something that used to be important to Canonical and the open source community, it just seems to have just been thrown out of the window with snapd. Canonical can no longer really check what devs do with Snaps, because of the fact that upstream devs can distribute directly into software branches to end users. And snaps update directly with your system.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">One good example of why they simply work much more poorly is how the Audacity snap out of the box, has problem reaching any audio interface to record from. So now we’re tasking new users to investigate this said issue with the snap version, while it was supposed to help newer users. A one-click install or always having the most recent version should never take any precedence over an apps' basic functionalities that work fine under a traditional install with dpkg.
                <p class="mb-5">Second major issue is that when they do install right, sometimes the apps don’t even work at all. With that I mean the app is just a white screen that does nothing. 
                With dpkg during the install it would give you lots of information on what went wrong or how to troubleshoot the issue. Which packages are required, which packages are in conflict with each other, etc. With the coming of Snap packages, troubleshooting issues now also has an additional layer of challange to it. First to learn snap inner workings and understand errors logging, and then to find a fix if it even exists.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-5">The third major issue, is that Snaps are on average like 30% slower to load up compared to the .deb variant when you do actually get one installed properly. And yes I have timed it. Firefox on 22.04 which is now a default Snap, feels like you can go get a coffee every time you open the app from cold start. I noticed that I had the Snap installed the moment I had updated my system to the newest version. When I removed it and installed the .deb or compiled it from builds, it was lightening fast.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">And this is the same for lots of other apps, not just Firefox. They will also take up more space on your system, because they hold those duplicate packages that cannot be individually tracked by apt anymore. Granted, they're not very big packages so it’s not a huge thing, but for Ubuntu, an OS that prides itself for running on small footprints, again it does not win any style points for these choices. Since Ubuntu 16.04 and up, the default way to install new software through the GUI is through the software center. That is, if you're not aware of the fact that you could be installing .deb files from the command line. And you should be, if you take any pride in your Linux OS! </p>
                
                <p class="mb-5">What’s worse is that since Ubuntu 22.04 the Firefox Snap version is made default in preference of the .deb version, and on top of that, they also completely changed the way apt handles Firefox without any notifications or warnings. Now in version 22.04, when you use command “ apt install firefox”, your system will install the Snap package by default as opposed to the .deb, which is not at all how apt has ever worked before. This is very counterintuitive and a bit sneaky, considering we have had ‘snap install’  commands to perform those exact operations for a while now, and the systems have worked along side each other just fine all this time. Forcing people to use a snap instead of a deb and then just changing around the commands to be something else is not the way we do things!</p>
                <p class="mb-5">By extension, this also means anyone who is not aware of this huge architectural design change in Ubuntu 22.04 could be having a severely downgraded user experience, simply by using all the Ubuntu default installed software. And I might add, any new software you would additionally install through the software center will also always be a Snap, since the Software Store in Ubuntu is now just a skin for Snapd. You need to really go out of your way to find a .deb file nowadays, or compile from source code.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">When it comes to development for snaps, you have a confinement levels devmode, classic and strict. Strict, denies all system access other than through a Snaps interface, where classic level permits full system-level access, which is analogous to a regular .deb or rpm installation.
                Ubuntu documentation states the the vast majority of Snaps should be able to attain strict confinement and not classic. But in practice, this seems to not be the case at all, or devs are not paying attention while writing apps I guess.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">They are also just incredibly poorly maintained, considering the fact that they don’t even adhere to any native GNOME system theming by default, while that is kind of the entire point of GNOME themes, and again, in some sense also GNOME’s design philosophy. And yes, I know you can set a default theme for snaps, that is also often a bit broken unfortunately, and it just adds more steps to installing things if you want them to look good.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Honestly the Linux community in general need to start understanding their target audiences a bit better I feel sometimes. Stop trying to please everyone at once, it simply can’t be done. In my opinion, none of this would be an issue anyways, if the snapd system was just a nice little feature for those few select programs that you couldn’t go without it for. In my opinion, that should be 0 times, because I don’t even have Snapd installed anymore, but that’s besides the point. I can imagine some people liking it for whatever reason they choose to still use it.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-5">I am very confused as to who Canonical is catering their OS towards recently. 
                When you look at all the stuff that’s not even included in even the latest version of Ubuntu in the current computer landscape of 2023, it's kind of insane that that kind of stuff is missing. 
                Things I want to mention are: No volume slider, no ability to select audio interfaces/devices for headset or speakers, no out of the box hibernation and sleep functionality for laptops, no WiFi reload button, which means always have to turn off/on your whole WiFi interface, a broken software store that does not allow uninstalling, extremely poor support for hybrid-mode GPU laptops. (Bumblebee/Optimus anyone?) I could go on for a while like this about features that should really be present out of the box on an OS yet still aren’t.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">But apparently there is time to make snapd! Honestly we are lucky as users that we have a community of dedicated devs developing GNOME extensions in their spare time to fix all that stuff that should be included by default in Ubuntu. Why are we pretending that the people that use this OS in any capacity are the same people that asked for snaps? Or do you not care about the end-users, but only the devs of Ubuntu? And then why would the devs like the snaps? I’m so confused lol.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Since I don't like to only rant, and also like to come up with solutions, let’s talk about some options. If we had just simply adhered to the same design that we have for the ubuntu-updates GUI window that was already a thing that existed, all of our lives (especially mine) would be so much better.
                Remember, you have already made it before. You can do it again. You have the technology! 
                Why are we not simply building a similar shell over dpkg/apt with the actual error logging that we can work with, as a software store, instead of the Snapd Software Store! Just like it already existed, exactly like that, for the ubuntu-updates app!
                </p>
                <p class="mb-5">Having error logging is literally better than a white blank screen!
                Then we could still improve the Snaps over time for them to be less horrible. Snaps back then and still need much more work before they become the default way to do anything in Ubuntu.</p>
                
                
                <p class="mb-5">Canonical, I have fantasies about Snapd being admitted for the mistake that it is soon, and it being dropped as a project. Then we can all return to using deb packages like good old boys and girls without a care in the world. But I also doubt that will happen.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">At least for my mental health, let Firefox be the only snap you sneak into dpkg in this manner. 
                Let dpkg be our last remaining beacon of hope, with this abomination among our midst. With all this said and done with, until Canonical finally decides to nuke Snapd into direct orbit, I suggest everyone running Ubuntu to all try a cheeky little .deb file instead of a Snap if you haven't already, they’re honestly pretty lit. Oh, and look up how to remove all of Snapd while you’re at it. Cheers.</p>
